It will take-off from the gains and lessons of various DA programs such as project tracking by geo-tagging and building capacity of LGUs and farming and fishing communities to manage and sustain agri-fishery support infrastructure and services, among others.\r\nThe Project will operationalize the national and regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (AFMPs) through integration of plans at the provincial level. Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.\r\n\r\nThe Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.\r\n\r\nLocal Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Development: this component aims to engage broad sections of the sector in the production of marketable surplus through investments in strategic segments of priority commodity value chains and strengthening collaboration between DA and the Local Government Units. It shall strengthen and develop viable agri-fishery based enterprises through efficient value chain of key regional agri-fishery product.\r\n\r\nProject Support: this component aims to provide efficient and effective project management and implementation, establish a standard on services and technical assistance and effective mode of engagement with LGUs.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000041","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '33', '34', '35', '36', '37', '38', '39', '40', '41', '42', '43', '44', '45', '46', '48', '49', '50', '51', '52', '53', '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '72', '73', '74', '75', '76', '77', '78', '81', '82', '83', '88']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":1,"rdc_endorsed":1,"rdc_endorsed_date":"2016-04-12","currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":"2013-06-26","sectors":"['3', '4', '6']","subsectors":"['7', '12', '13', '18']","status":"['7']","implementation_risk":"(1) Project Stakeholders: The risks associated with resistance and\/or slow uptake of the institutional reforms in the DA on which PRDP is built on appears to be diminishing as project implementation proceeds.

This will be distributed to all DA offices, agencies, bureau, corporation. others. (2) Governance of the Implementing Agency: The risk of governance issues within the DA and as they relate to LGUs in implementing the PRDP are increasingly diminishing as implementation of the Project gathers momentum. A high degree of staff, unit\/bureau and attached agency support has been developed through active program of institutional and stakeholder assessments, workshop and briefings.

HVCDP is a priority program of the Department of Agriculture created to help address food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable growth through increased farm income and productivity. The target service areas include convergence areas, strategic production zones and farm households. These areas need the interventions from the government in terms of production, extension, processing, marketing and regulatory support. The program is implemented yearly with a coverage of implementation down to barangay levels. The budgetary allocation for the implementation of PAP for the HVCDP is taken from the GAA with a cost sharing arrangement scheme. A specific guidelines in the PAPs implementation is being followed  by the DA RFUs together with partner implementers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \r\nComponents of the Program include:\r\n i.

that will be implemented by the  DA-BPI under a  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Agricultural Project with Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Korean private companies . The project aims to enhance production competitiveness of small and mid-sized farmers by establishing greenhouse technology for high value added agro-products, and increase farmers income by enhancing distribution channel in related to co-branding and local shipping in the Philippines.   The Korean Smart Farm Greenhouses offers the Philippine agriculture a possible solution to the country's climate change concern being experienced by our highland vegetable growers. It would be also a showcase for Good Agricultural Practice, addressing the food safety requirements in the Food Safety Law in the country.   The piloting of the Korean Style Greenhouse is also an avenue to get the advance climate proof greenhouse technology which can be utilized in organic crop production, and eventually gain an easy access to Korean market to boost Philippine agriculture. Aside from the productivity, the established operating software  will provide greenhouse environment information to farmers by mobile to help them manage operating risk. Also, the environmental and production data collected through the software will guide to establish environmental control system optimized in the local environment of the Philippines.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000070","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":15.0,"states_id":"['15']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['13']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"Ongoing.

functions per R.A. 9242, s. 2004, and the need to supply the requirement for raw materials of local weavers and knitters make the support to the Philippine fiber industry imperative.    \r\n\r\nCotton, as a primary component of home-made fabrics, having been grown for long in the country as an industry, is among the major fibers that need to be revitalized and sustained. The Philippines used to produce cotton supplying a portion of the need of the textile mills in the country. Highest production was attained in 1992 when area planted to cotton reached 35,000 hectares and produced 14,400 MT raw cotton fiber (cotton lint). However, due to serious economic and technical considerations on cotton growing in recent years, there had been a substantial decline in hectarage and participation in the industry, with areas just primarily confined in research stations to date. \r\n\r\n In as much as a home-grown cotton production technology had been developed, along with the availability of physical resources that convert cotton harvests into raw fiber, waiting to be refurbished for immediate use, cotton cultivation and processing can be sustained with proper support from the government. \r\n\r\nTo revitalize the cotton industry in order to sustain the production of cotton fibers for small-scale cotton users, such as local loom-weavers and knitters, and eventually for commercial-size cotton production and utilization.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000074","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":11.0,"states_id":"['1', '40', '41', '6', '7', '9',

devices to the cooperatives, an increased supply of handwoven fabrics made of abaca and other indigenous materials is expected which will uplift the living conditions of the members of the communities. The effect will benefit not only the members of the cooperatives but also their immediate families. A progressive weaving community with entrepreneurial capability is also expected with an expanded local and international market for fiber and fiber-based products. The LGUs in which the weaving communities are situated would benefit by promoting these establishments as a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for tourist and visitors.\r\n\r\n This project aims to improve the living conditions of handloom weavers as target beneficiaries in identified communities. It can be accomplished by provision of infrastructures\/facilities needed by the weaving communities, training them to improve their capability in order to avail of the income-generating opportunities as entrepreneurs.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000107","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":12.0,"states_id":"['15', '6', '7', '9', '12']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['1']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['19']","status":"['8']","implementation_risk":"Natural Disaster; Prevalence of Pests and Diseases;  \r\nDepending on the priority in the Region","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":8000000.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"On-going implementation of the projects","updates_date":"2019-10-24","mainpdp":8,"otherpdp":"[]","na_rm":null,"expected_outputs":"1.

see the achievement of the purpose of the law.\r\n\r\nThe NDA has created programs and projects that will increase the base population of dairy animals to increase milk volumes, empower dairy farmers and other stakeholders, facilitate the provision of dairy facilities and equipment, provide access to market and promote the marketability of locally produced milk.  \r\n\r\nThe main programs that NDA

- Global Sustainable Supply Chains for Marine Commodities","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['4']","description":"This project contributes to address key aspects of the market forces that drive overfishing. The project will add to the transformation of the seafood market by mainstreaming sustainability in the value chain of important commodities platforms, and fisheries improvement projects (FIP), developing national capacities, and generating learning to be shared worldwide. The project will allocate GEF resources strategically to 1) engage major seafood buyers in the main world markets (EU, Japan, US) into responsible sourcing, providing tools to prepare and implement sustainable seafood sourcing policies, 2) adapt the concept of green commodities platforms in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines to generate experience that could be used in other countries, 3) support stakeholders of these platforms to develop practical experience with fisheries improvement projects and upgrade existing tools for FIP implementation and monitoring, and 4) upgrade existing information platforms to facilitate access to reliable materials to value chain stakeholders in support of sound decision making, and capturing documenting and disseminating the learnings of the project. The project target fisheries include tuna fisheries in the Pacific Ocean, Mahi-mahi and large pelagic fish in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, Indonesian snapper, Octopus and blue swimming crab fisheries in Philippines.\r\nThe project is an inter-regional intervention. Market engagement and knowledge management are global components. The sustainable marine commodities platforms and FIPs will be implemented, using a participatory approach in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia and Philippines.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000120","spatial_coverage_id":1,"region_id":13.0,"states_id":"['5', '6', '7', '8', '9',

activities on tobacco production and this done by applying new technologies to increase farmers' efficiencies of labor utilization and increased productivity and income.  The program provides assistance in the form of technology and financial support in acquiring farm machineries and equipment with minimal interest of 2% per annum and one-time service fee of 1% to tobacco-based cooperatives\/associations which  is payable in 3 to 10 years depending on the amount availed.  The cooperatives in turn can generate income through the rentals on the use of these equipment.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n1. Provide financial support to farmers organizations in acquiring tractors and its accessories; \r\n2.  Provide income generation project for associations and cooperatives; \r\n3.  Increase the yield and net income of farmers; \r\n4.  Generate data\/information which are essential in formulating policies for future projects of the same nature; 5.  Evaluate the technical and economic performance of the machineries.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000130","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":2.0,"states_id":"['15',

Infrastructure\r\n\r\n1. Establishment of Dairy Marketing Centers \r\na. These marketing centers, equipped with chillers, shall be established within existing NDA-assisted dairy zones or dairy areas. It must be situated in strategic areas or commercial centers where local consumers can easily access the products. \r\nb. Dairy farmers can go to these dairy marketing centers to sell their products. Since smallhold dairy farmers will undergo capability training on home based processing, they will be able to process their own products, sell through these marketing centers and earn more income.  \r\nc.  The NDA will initially oversee the center under its Business Development Unit and eventually tap the NDA trained personnel of the Federation or dairy cooperatives to manage or run the centers. The dairy cooperatives\/federations\/private entities shall pay corresponding commissioned-based fees to NDA for every product sold in the center. The fees collected will go back to the marketing centers to cover the maintenance costs.\r\nd. NDA will continuously monitor the marketing centers.\r\n\r\n2. Establishment of Dairy Post-harvest facilities \r\na. Post-harvest facilities such as milk collection centers with cold storage equipment shall be established to ensure the quality of milk collected for processing plants. \r\nb. Farmers can go to these collection centers and sell their raw milk produce and the collection center will bring the milk to the milk processing plant.\r\nc. The NDA will establish these milk collection centers and shall be leased (Lease to own scheme) to cooperatives or federations.\r\nd. Through a partnership forged between the federation or cooperatives and the marketing center thru NDA, products from the milk processing plants will be supplied to the marketing centers.\r\n\r\nB. Capacity Building\r\n\r\nAs the country recognizes the need to develop its dairy industry, priority programs such as training programs for dairy farmers and cooperatives shall be enhanced. Dairy sector\u2019s competiveness and capacities will be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. The following trainings will be conducted:\r\na. Homebased Milk Processing\r\nb. Milk Quality Assurance\r\nc. Business Management (Accounting & Bookkeeping)\r\nd. Milk Marketing\r\ne. Trainings on other business opportunities (meat processing (for male calves), vermi-culture, biogas, forage production)\r\n\r\nThis project aims to enhance existing dairy-based livelihood particularly on milk collection, processing and marketing to make dairying a sustainable source of income for dairy farmers. It intends to promote the marketability of locally produced milk and milk products.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000135","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":11.0,"states_id":"['16', '3', '40', '7', '10', '11']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['85']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['18']","status":"['3']","implementation_risk":"As of date no funding source","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"Have yet to identify funding source","updates_date":"2018-10-25","mainpdp":8,"otherpdp":"['9']","na_rm":null,"expected_outputs":"1.

- Dairy Goat Farming: A Livelihood Opportunity for Rural Farm families","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['7']","description":"The proposed program will revolve around a community dairy goat farming concept. In this concept, communities will be identified where dairy goat farms will be established and will function as a goat multiplier farm, dairy production area, and learning site. In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nIn the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to safeguard the project and the animals from threats like non-compliance of beneficiaries, lack of resources, and poor monitoring and to ensure that the targets are achieved and the recipients will experience the impact of the program in their lives.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000142","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['17']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['18']","status":"['3']","implementation_risk":"Implementation Risk as follows:\r\n1.

be a prohibitive and labor-intensive farming activity unlike crop farming.  Government investments have always been hugely spent for rice and high value crops while dairy programs were minimally funded in comparison.  \r\n\r\nStatistics show that despite the lack of investments, the growth of the dairy sector has been at an average of 6.3% (2010-2015).  Small hold dairy farmers have considered dairy farming as their livelihood that can provide for their families needs.  The most compelling reason why dairy farmers continue to pursue dairying as a living is profit.\r\n\r\nThe government, the private sector and future dairy players need to be convinced that dairy farming and all of its related activities are profitable, hence, need investments.  The local dairy industry needs to be promoted as one of the agricultural commodity poverty reduction driver particularly in the rural areas.  Studies shall be documented and backed up by scientific evidence to firm up the cause, hence, this study.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000143","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['12', '15', '17', '18', '37', '40', '49', '54']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"Project proposal submitted to FAO for possible funding","updates_date":"2019-10-18","mainpdp":8,"otherpdp":"[]","na_rm":null,"expected_outputs":"1.

- Strengthening Capacities of Dairy Farmers & Extension Workers","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['4', '6', '7']","description":"The National Dairy Authority (NDA) was established in 1995. It is the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry through policy direction and program coordination and implementation. The main goal of the NDA is to establish a profitable, competitive and sustainable growing dairy industry built on financially viable business performance throughout the value chain, providing good quality of life for farmers and ensuring consumers safe and quality milk and milk products.Majority of the Philippines\u2019s annual dairy requirement is supplied by importers and processors. Local production continues to increase annually but not enough to cover local demand. In 2017 it imported 417,07 million kilograms of milk by 185 importers, processors and traders. In same year local production was only 22,76 million kilograms of milk. Milk is third largest agri-import.Philippines\u2019s dairy sector represents a big potential for an improvement of a quality of life in rural areas. Development of milk production will have positive effects on unemployment rate and socio-economic situation in rural areas.  The NDA is given very limited funds every year to capacitate a total of 2,418 dairy farmers in dairy production and management. The lack of funds contributed to the very limited technical assistance the NDA can provide to these dairy farmers resulting to wrong practices and not enough knowledge to run a dairy enterprise and make it profitable.\r\n\r\nThe NDA is focused on improvement of situation. In 2017, the NDA and Czech Republic\u2019s Development Assistance (program Aid for Trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) have started a new project focused on situation of dairy sector in Philippines - \u201cAssistance in analyzing and improving value chains in the dairy industry in Philippines\u201d. In scope of the project, Czech dairy experts have visited Philippines\u2019s farms. They have identified three main issues that are complicating development of dairy industry in Philippines:\r\ninsufficient capacities of extension workers\r\n- insufficient capacities of dairy farmers \r\n- insufficient promotion of local (Philippines\u2019s) production and consumption\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is consistent with and directly supports the NDA Charter Statement and Strategy Map (Annex A) of improving the stakeholders\u2019 welfare, ensuring the enforcement of dairy quality standards from production to post-harvest, advocate for the patronage of local milk and milk products and enhancing the competency of NDA manpower and farmer-clients.\r\nFinally, the proposed project will help realize the Philippine Agriculture\u2019s goals of expanding opportunities for those engaged in agriculture production and increasing access of small and subsistence farmers to economic opportunities as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000145","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['17']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":1,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"18 September 2018 \u2013 The project was endorsed to the Embassy of Czech Republic for possible funding.\r\n\r\n23 January 2019 \u2013 The project was endorsed to the Project Development Service (DA-PDS).\r\n\r\n27 July 2019 \u2013 NDA was informed thru a letter from Geotest that dairy experts will arrive in the Philippines for the conduct of the training on 5-13 August 2019 .\r\n\r\nGuidebooks were created and used in the training for dairy farmers and extension workers conducted by Czech Republic Dairy Experts last August 4-17, 2019","updates_date":"2019-10-22","mainpdp":8,"otherpdp":"['9']","na_rm":null,"expected_outputs":"The project \u201cStrengthening Capacities of Dairy Farmers & Extension Workers\u201d has three main outputs.\r\n\r\nOUTPUT 1: Capacity of dairy extension workers have been increased\r\nFirst output will be achieved by training of 20 dairy extensions workers of NDA in 4 Philippines\u2019s regions.

- Sisal Development Project","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['1', '5', '8']","description":"Sisal is wildly and sporadically growing in almost all of the provinces of Central Visayas, specifically in the provinces of Cebu and Siquijor.  In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and\/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and\/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  \r\n        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer\u2019s association and farmer-beneficiaries.\r\n        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;\r\n(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);\r\n(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;\r\n(3) produce and distribute at least 882,000 sisal planting materials (propagated sisal bulbils and suckers) to the target farmer-beneficiaries during implementation period; and\r\n(4) capacitate the Stakeholders (LGU and farmer-beneficiaries) through conduct of Packaged of Technology (POT) on Sisal production from farm establishment to its cultural practices up to harvesting and its post-harvest practices as well as fiber quality improvement technologies.  \r\n(5) Ten (10) hectares of sisal is to be planted in Region I to supply the needs of the local pulp millers.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000150","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":7.0,"states_id":"['1', '7']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['15', '25', '34', '52',

abaca cultivation area from 0 ha to 500 ha at the end and increase average yearly income of abaca farmers with certification by 10%. Results include: \r\n\r\n- The production output of abaca fibres was increased up from 10 kg of fiber\/day to 120 kg\/day following the provision of simple machines that make it easier for the smallholder farmers to extract the fibres from the leaf sheaths. This contributed to the increase in income of the farmers. \r\n\r\n- A total of 36 smallholder farmers have been Rainforest Alliance certified on 149 ha of agricultural land (500 ha originally planned). \r\n\r\nThe present strategic alliance aims to harness the results and lessons learnt for the diversification and expansion of the Abaca Sustainability Initiative (ASI), i.e. knowledge and experience are to be disseminated to new regions and firmly established with a view to achieve a broad impact and promoting structure-building results. \r\n\r\nUnder ASI+, the approach is to be extended. The proven concept of GIZ's Farmer Business School approach will be introduced to promote the entrepreneurial skills and business management capacity of the smallholder farmers and their organizations in order to identify opportunities for enhancing their business operations and incomes. In addition, applied abaca research will be resumed, and the task of promoting resilience in the face of climate change will be addressed. The project approach will be extended within the Visayas region and will also be transferred to Mindanao.\r\n\r\nPromoting sustainable development such as enhancing the livelihoods of the poor, using

of Sustainable Abaca Industry in Eastern Visayas","type_id":1,"regular":0,"bases":"['4']","description":"Eastern Visayas is among the top abaca producing region in the Philippines. According to the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), abaca production in the regions amounted to 20,000 metric tons in 2011, making it the second highest producer of abaca in the country following the Bicol region. It also had 39,500 hectares of land planted to abaca in that year1. With the continued introduction of new applications and other significant uses, abaca strengthen its position as one of the major crops in the country with high export potential and continues to be one of the main sources of income among farmers in the region. \r\n\r\nThrough the years, the productions of abaca were drastically going down because of the infestation of abaca diseases and natural calamities that hits the region. Several abaca areas are now unproductive because of slow rehabilitation activities due to lack of fund for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to rejuvenate the abaca industry in the region by rehabilitating abaca areas specially those already been treated under the abaca disease management project, to open new abaca areas, establishment of nurseries, distribution of farm inputs and capability building.\r\n\r\nIncrease farmers' income through increase in

Activities under consideration include institutional and procedural strengthening of Marine Protected Areas and coastal habitats; management of fish stocks using modern technologies; development of coastal vegetation, and co-management of municipal waters with coastal communities, law enforcement and certification on fisheries sustainability and traceability\r\n\r\nComponent 3: Modern and Resilient Fisheries and Aquaculture Enterprises, Infrastructure and Support Facilities - supports modernization of fisheries and aquaculture enterprises throughout the value supply chain including investments on climate-resilient infrastructure, support facilities, system development, credit and insurance access, and logistics. Activities under consideration include development, management and modernization of aquaculture and capture fisheries; adoption of climate-smart production technologies, enhanced entrepreneurial support along with investment in post-harvest facilities, logistics, and improved compliance with manufacturing and food safety and quality standards\r\n\r\nComponent 4: Project Management and Coordination\r\nThe Project Management and Coordination will be set up in the BFAR will be responsible for the everyday activity for this program. It will also coordinate with various implementing agencies and NGOs, and liaise with the funding agency. There will also be an establishment of Project Implementation Units (PIU) at the Regional Fisheries Office that will oversee and be responsible in the field implementation of the activities. As the contribution of the recipient communities and LGUs, FMA Units will be created to coordinate activities with the PMC and the PIU. As a result, the effective and sustainable implementation of the project will be sustained.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2020-05001-000306","spatial_coverage_id":1,"region_id":null,"states_id":"[]","inter":null,"provinces_id":"[]","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":1,"cip_typo":3.0,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":"Yet to be submitted to NEDA Secretariat","neda_secretariat_review_date":"2020-01-01","neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['19']","status":"['9']","implementation_risk":"Not yet identified.

DHI, DHIA, or DHIR specifically for large animals. This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd\u2019s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to benefit some 150,000 dairy farmers and 190 organized groups.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000188","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":13.0,"states_id":"['1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '11', '12', '14', '15', '16', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '31', '32', '34', '35', '36', '37', '39', '40', '41', '43', '45', '46', '48', '49', '51', '52', '53', '55', '56', '57', '58', '60', '61', '62', '63', '64', '65', '66', '67', '68', '69', '70', '71', '73', '74', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":1,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"The project has been presented to the DA-wide Clearinghouse Committee.

advancements happening in the rubber industry, rubber stakeholders must be capacitated in order to address the need to increase production and be able to obtain a generous monthly income.  Production is not the sole problem that remains to be addressed, but also the low income of smallholders which is by far the rallying cry of every rubber farmer from now and then. Hence, this program aims to address this seemingly insurable crisis in the Philippine rubber economy.  Republic Act 10089 states, \"undertake training and capacity-building programs for rubber producers, processors and cooperatives in order to increase production of quality rubber and raises level of income especially of poor smallholders.\" Given this function, PRRI shall conduct trainings\/seminars\/workshops to essentially capacitate the rubber smallholders, specifically the rubber farmers so that they will be alleviated from their former state of only earning meager income. Training to be conducted will enhance the knowledge and skills of rubber farmers in rubber plantation, and nursery and bud wood garden establishment and management, harvesting and post-harvesting of rubber to increase the productivity and improve the quality of rubber thus increase the income of rubber farmers.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000202","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['2', '40', '41', '7', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13',

- Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project (ATBSP)","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['3']","description":"The Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project (ATBSP) is the new approach to be implemented by the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA) in the production of excellent abaca fiber. This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction\/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting\/Hauling and Tuxy Trading \/Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.\r\n\r\nThe project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation. Feasibility study and logical framework was conducted and formulated thus, ready for takeoff once budget is available.\r\n\r\nATBSP is aligned to the newly approved Abaca Industry Roadmap of PhilFIDA. It is expected to meet the demand for the high-quality abaca fibers and uplift the status of life of abaca farmers most specially the indigenous people in rural areas.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000204","spatial_coverage_id":1,"region_id":null,"states_id":"[]","inter":null,"provinces_id":"[]","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"with

- Production Performance of Matured Rubber Trees Applied with Low Tapping Frequency at Varrying Levels of Latex Stimulants","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['4', '5', '7', '8']","description":"The cultivation of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in the Philippines is predominantly played by small rubber farmers holding only three hectares or less. With the unstable current market price of natural rubber latex, most tappers seek other income generating activity to augment the families\u2019 basic needs that solely depend on rubber latex production. Thus, the rubber industry is facing a scarcity of skilled tapper laborers. Tapping is the most costly activity in natural rubber production and the shortage of tappers is a serious problem in rubber plantations in the country. Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) systems are considered to be a solution to these issues by reducing the number of tappers required while increasing tappers' income.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the need to improve the productivity and competitiveness of rubber cultivation is compulsory such as reduction of tapping labor and applying low tapping frequencies that may lessen the operational cost and can increase the marginal profit of rubber farmers. This activity will be compensated by the increase of hormonal stimulation by providing latex stimulant. With this tapping orientation, the profit of rubber tappers may increase since they will not solely depend on rubber tapping as their source of income.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000204","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":9.0,"states_id":"['9']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['80']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"(1)

Breeding cycle in rubber extends to 20-30 years between pollination and yield assessment distributed over three selection stages.

Condition","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['4', '5', '7', '8']","description":"Corynespora Leaf Fall Disease (CLFD) caused by a fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola is one of the major diseases which poses serious threat to natural rubber production in rubber growing countries of South and South East Asia (Edathil et.al. 2000).This disease is regularly causing more damage in any plant growth stages (i.e. nursery, immature and mature trees). Occurrence of this disease causes repeated post wintering defoliation that adversely affect the tree, resulting in reduced production and yield loss can be of more than 45 per cent. \r\n\r\nIn order to keep the sustainability of quality rubber production, there is a need to have an efficient disease management strategy in modern rubber growing. Despite the economic effect of CLF disease-causing pathogen on commercially grown rubber in the Philippines, screening for susceptibility among clones as a method to improve the management of this disease have not been examined. Thus, this study aims to identify and evaluate potential susceptible and resistant clones and specie to Corynespora Leaf Fall disease from introduced Hevea clones and specie by inducing CLFD-pathogen to the leaves of seedlings of different rubber clones in nursery to determine whether clonal variation could be used to better manage the disease problem.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000207","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":9.0,"states_id":"['9']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['80']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"(1)

to a plethora of economically important pathological problems, mainly of fungal origin, the Basidiomycetes. Pests and diseases of rubber could prevent and reduce the full yield potential in the rubber industry. \r\n\r\nLimited information can be found regarding the distribution of termite pest and fungal diseases of rubber in the Philippines. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of these diseases in and among rubber plantations and on consequences related to disease infection or disorder and eventual latex yield loss is important to consider in formulating effective integrated disease management strategies. This is also critical in sustaining the rubber industry especially in rehabilitating senile rubber plantations as planting materials can be severely infected to fungal diseases present in the field or from the neighboring rubber plantations. GIS maps are one of the tools in forecasting disease outbreaks and estimating damage and consequently in designing cost-effective and location-specific pest and disease management strategies appropriate for different cropping systems in the Zamboanga Peninsula. Thus, this study will potentially support the lack of technical knowledge of rubber farmers on rubber production and management especially on the control of pests and diseases in the region.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000208","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":9.0,"states_id":"['9']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['78', '79', '80']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":1,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"1.

of rubber plantation in the country were lack of supply of quality planting materials, and low price of rubber products. One of the function of Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI)  is to propagate and promote quality rubber planting materials, enable rubber industry stakeholders particularly smallholder rubber farmers to have access to quality rubber trees seedlings and showcase modern production techniques and other support services. With this project, it aims to comprehensively realize the goals of human empowerment and economic development in the countryside through programs and projects that will increase rubber production in the country and improve the quality of life especially in poor rural communities that depend primarily in this industry and to increase the available quality planting materials that are needed in the expansion of rubber areas.\t\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project aims to: \r\n\r\n(1) To increase production of rubber through distribution of quality planting materials that are needed for the expansion of rubber areas; and\r\n(2) To establish and maintain PRRI Rubber Nursery in support to the distribution of quality planting materials to rubber farmer associations and cooperatives.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000210","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['41', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12',

Necessary facilities are needed to be set up in order to fully materialize the goal of PRRI. Thus, this PRRI building will be established with different testing laboratories to aid in the research needs and requests from the rubber stakeholders for testing. The laboratories are the following: pest control laboratory, rubber testing laboratory, soil testing laboratory, and genetics laboratory. This will also house the different divisions of the agency: Rubber Technology and Extension Division (RTESD), Crop Management Division (CMD), Genetics Resources Improvement Division (GRID), Office of the Executive Director (OED). Conference room, audio visual room, electric room and ICT room, and dormitory will also form part of the

integrated resource-service convergence approach to increase farm productivity and incomes of the small coconut farming communities.\r\n\r\nThe program has four (4) components, namely:\r\n1) Coconut-Coffee Enterprise Development Project;\r\n2) Coconut-Cacao-Based Enterprise Development Project;\r\n3) Coconut Intercropping Project; and\r\n4) Community\/Household-level Coconut Processing Project.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the program aims to: \r\n1. Encourage an integrated coconut-based enterprise by putting in place appropriate development support systems; \r\n2. Showcase coconut-based enterprise model through farm diversification and value-adding technologies managed by CBO or MSME as a tool for income and job generations;\r\n3.  Improve and promote farmers' access to technology, production support services, information, credit and market; and\r\n4. Harness capacities of CBOs and\/or MSMEs and members including women, as entrepreneurs using coconut as the medium.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000215","spatial_coverage_id":1,"region_id":null,"states_id":"[]","inter":null,"provinces_id":"[]","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"15,697

This amount excludes the   hauling and other logistics cost for the transferring which has gone 6x (6 buildings in the span of 32 years).  By this, the agency also has to spend substantial amount on renting training\/seminar venues.

farmers\u2019 groups and agricultural technicians of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and training services are among those banner programs of PhilFIDA. Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and\/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. \r\n\r\nData and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nVoice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.\r\n\r\nThe ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals. This also includes the proposed ICT organizational structure to cope with changing requirements and fast-paced technology.\r\n\r\nThis ISSP covers the Central Office, Laboratories, Experimental Stations and all Regional and Provincial Offices of PhilFIDA.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000221","spatial_coverage_id":1,"region_id":null,"states_id":"[]","inter":null,"provinces_id":"[]","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['5']","subsectors":"[]","status":"['2', '8', '9']","implementation_risk":"Non-approval of  proposed funds, hence, approval of proposed funds","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":50000000.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"Complete packaged of proposal with Plans and Design for Infrastructure.","updates_date":"2019-10-17","mainpdp":8,"otherpdp":"['11']","na_rm":null,"expected_outputs":"The project aims to modernized the processes of the agency in the performance of its functions.

Industry Development: Enhancing the Services of the National Stud Farm Through Research and Development","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['8']","description":"Horses have been in the Philippines since pre-Hispanic times. Ancestors of the present-day Philippine horse, which were either of Malay and Indian stock, were brought into the country by traders and travelers from Indonesia by way of Sulu or of Chinese bloodlines (Mackie, 1916). These horses were crossed to purebred horses brought in by successive colonizers with the purpose of improving the native breed as they were believed to be small in stature and considered not fit for military use. Horses that were considered \u201csmall\u201d were relegated to farm use, for hauling farm produce. Most of these horses were also depended upon as daily conveyance by those who cannot afford to own a horse.\r\n\r\nToday, horses still perform a significant role in agriculture and in our daily life. Known for their strength, speed, sure-footedness and intelligence, horses remain as the source of draft power in remote areas. The horse is also popular in equestrian sports such as racing, polo, pleasure-riding and rodeos which generate jobs that stimulate industry and promote tourism. When the need arises, it becomes an alternative source of protein and funds in emergency situations. Several towns still use horses to pull the calesa as an alternative to motorized transport and as a tool to promote tourism. Horse-fighting is also popular in some areas because of cultural practices. The horse is also expected to figure prominently in the promotion of agri-tourism. \r\n\r\nWith the important role of horses in Philippine agriculture, it is imperative that support be provided to harness its full potential as work animal, as a potential source of food and livelihood.\r\nThis project aims to conserve and improve the Philippine horse as a source draft power, food and livelihood.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000229","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":40.0,"states_id":"['40']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['12']","pip":1,"pip_typo":2.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"With approved concept note and project proposal and detailed engineering design.

Milk Collection Centers\r\n   - Five (5) existing milk collection centers owned by different cooperatives collecting at least 5,000 liters of milk per day will be selected.\r\n   - A solar power system will be developed to power each of the five (5) selected collection centers based on an 80 kilowatt consumption of the center per day.\r\nB. Milking Parlors\r\n  - Five (5) existing dairy farms owned by different cooperatives with at least 50 heads on the milk line shall be selected.\r\n  - A solar power system will be developed to power each of the five (5) selected collection centers based on a 40 kilowatt consumption of the milking parlor per day.\r\nIn both units, France will tap the services of a solar power company to design, install and maintain the said solar power generator. To pay for the maintenance of the solar power system, the recipients shall pay corresponding fees to the NDA for maintenance cost of the system.\r\nIt is projected that with the solar power, the cooperative shall pay at a lower cost per\/kwh used for the corresponding amount of energy using electric power.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000245","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['17']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['19']","status":"['3']","implementation_risk":"Risk is project funding as of date.

sustainable and improved production of rubber industry is anchored on proper and well-developed decision making, enhanced productivity to adopt new technology and innovation. An inclusive and globally competitive rubber industry providing sustainable benefits to all stakeholders is envisioned for the Philippine rubber industry, with the goal of increasing the benefits of all the stakeholders, thereby spreading the gains down to the smallholders in the remote barangays in all rubber producing provinces in the regions. For the past year, low production of rubber yield emerges as a major constraint in the rubber industry which is mainly attributed in low pricing, in addition the improper fertilization management\/nutrient management, emergence of pests and diseases, uses of unsuited rubber clones for plantation, lack of information on rubber clone agronomic characteristics and natural calamities. The development of technologies to support decision-making in production, pricing, good agricultural practices, market, pest and diseases management. The derived information will be useful for the farmers, planners, and researchers. Philippines Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) needs timely accurate statistics on natural rubber regularly to monitor and to take suitable measures in the interest of the Philippines rubber sector.\t\r\n\r\nGenerally, this study will enable the Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) to map the areas vulnerable to soil erosion, estimating the area for further cultivation, and clone suitability map through GIS and Remote Sensing technologies. Furthermore this study will assess the spatial distribution of rubber area over different classes of elevation and slope and the traditional rubber clone\u2019s farmer\u2019s preference, it will help to fully understand the dynamics of rubber plantation activity in the rubber traditional regions of the Philippines and understanding the variation in the productivity of rubber ecosystem in the Philippines.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000249","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":14.0,"states_id":"['9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['2', '3', '9', '16', '21', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30', '41', '42', '44', '48', '49', '66', '69', '71', '72', '73', '74', '76', '78', '79', '80', '81', '82', '83', '88']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":1,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['5']","subsectors":"[]","status":"['9']","implementation_risk":"Implementation Risks: Slow to non - participation of the rubber farmer to thier responsibilities of the project.

- Farm Mechanization","type_id":2,"regular":0,"bases":"['4', '7']","description":"Dairy farming today requires the use of farm machineries and equipment which are considered valuable inputs particularly in forage production and pasture development.  While such equipment offers a wide range of benefits in terms of developing and increasing production of forage for dairy animals, not all dairy farmers have the capacity to purchase their own equipment taking into account the financial obligations that they need to fulfil in managing their respective farms.\r\n\r\nAs the agency mandated to accelerate the development of the local dairy industry, the NDA is committed to providing the local dairy farmers the access to various dairy equipment and facilities that can be of great help in improving their dairy farm operations. It is in this light, that the NDA would like to propose the provision of one (1) agricultural tractor, one (1) forage chopper, one (1) truck, and one (1) warehouse to each of the six (6) Regional Departments of the NDA namely, Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Southern Mindanao. \r\n\r\nThe NDA shall be the executing agency of the project whose major tasks include: formulating rules and guidelines as regards to the use of the tractor and forage chopper; deployment of the equipment to the requesting farmers\/farmers' groups; overall maintenance of the equipment; and conduct of regular monitoring of the project. \r\n\r\nThe NDA uses this proposed project as the vehicle to support local dairy farmers in their goal of further enhancing dairy farm operations to achieve better milk yield and ensuring the availability of feeds for dairy animals. In addition, the agency seeks to develop more contract growers to serve as feeds source of the local dairy farmers and contract growers for specialized skills in calf rearing and grow-out farming. \r\n\r\nThe tractors, trucks, and forage choppers would be provided on hire basis to the local dairy farmers through the NDA Regional Department assisting them. Each department shall be responsible in ensuring the equity in the distribution of assistance to the farmers.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance farm operations and increase forage production of local dairy farmers. It also aims to develop more contract growers as feeds source.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000254","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":11.0,"states_id":"['3', '40', '7', '10', '11']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['12', '17', '25', '29', '81']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"No project fund as of September 2019.

Through these herd build-up strategies, the existing underutilized government stock farms will be able to house more dairy animals. Also, more stock farms will be established to accommodate more dairy animals. Latest technology in animal breeding and milk collection will be made available in these farms\/centers. \r\n\r\nThe project moves along the programs of rural industrialization and industry dispersal as provided for in Republic Act 8435, also known as the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA). The establishment of milk processing centers and engagement in dairy farming will give opportunities for employment to residents in rural areas near the centers and farms and will reduce propensity to migrate to urban areas.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to contribute in the dairy industry development in the country, specifically:\r\n  - Contribute 95% of the national milk target (or 40% of the milk deficiency3) through sustainable production and processing of 125 tons of local milk daily by increasing the number of dairy animals by at least one (1) boatload (1,200 head) every year through importation and upgrade of local dairy cattle;\r\n  - To create livelihood and employment opportunities in accordance to the rural industrialization and dispersal programs provided for in the AFMA.","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000258","spatial_coverage_id":2,"region_id":11.0,"states_id":"['40', '5', '6', '7', '10', '11']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['40']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":1,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"['6']","subsectors":"['19']","status":"['3']","implementation_risk":"To be determined once the project document is finalized","ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":2,"icc_required":0,"updates":"Pre-feasibilty was done by DAP through PDS.

and utilization to address issues and concerns related to fiber production, quality and utilization of natural fibers such as abaca, banana, pineapple, sisal and other minor fibers. Specifically, the sub-program component undertakes the following;1.1 Design\/development\/improvement of  machines\/tools\/devices;  1.2.  Identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization development and identification of new uses for natural fibers to promote their utilization in line with environment  conciousness for green economy and utilization of renewable resources; 1.3  Raw material manipulation of fibers to create a variety of different effects using fibers, fabrics and other materials for the different fiber properties 1.4 Disseminate developed  technologies as technology source for community -based livelihood project in coordination with ESETS. The Fiber Utilization and Technology Division (FUTD) personnel who developed the technologies acted as Resource Speaker in disseminating  the techniques, cost and return analysis and sustainability approaches for each recipient association\/organization\/cooperative to develop them into a   business enterprise as source of livelihood.\r\n1.4  Laboratory services on fiber identification, analysis of morphological, physical and chemical properties of fibers are undertaken to cater to the needs of the industry stakeholders such as the farmers, cordage makers, pulp processors and trade exporters of raw fibers. The Fiber Processing and Utilization Laboratory (FPUL) provides state-of-the-art capabilities for the testing and study of natural fibers emphasizing the characteristics to achieve desired fiber properties and functions.  It is a science-based user facility simultaneously developing strong scientific programs while offering broad access to its capabilities and collaboration. The FPUL can assist the businesses in complying with the requests needed.  The sectors that would most likely support the upgrading of the FPUL are the farmers, fiber processors, academe, private businessmen and LGUs. In all cases, the local government units always request FPUL for technical assistance in terms of value-adding activities and income generation\/employment opportunities.  These activities can easily be adapted by their constituents because of the following reasons: a.  Doable and can be considered as a backyard industry b.  Developed products \r\n\r\n1. Developed machines\/tools \/devices ; 2. Generated technologies on fiber proccessing and utilization that can be disseminated to industry sector and communities in coordination with LGUs to improve livelihood","agency_id":19,"motheragency_id":0,"pipol_code":"2021-05001-000288","spatial_coverage_id":3,"region_id":16.0,"states_id":"['16']","inter":null,"provinces_id":"['85']","pip":1,"pip_typo":1.0,"rd":0,"cip":0,"cip_typo":null,"infrastructure":0,"rdip":0,"rdc_required":0,"rdc_endorsed":0,"rdc_endorsed_date":null,"currentlevel":null,"neda_secretariat_review_date":null,"neda_submission_date":null,"icc_endorsed_date":null,"icc_approved_date":null,"neda_board_date":null,"sectors":"[]","subsectors":"[]","status":"[]","implementation_risk":null,"ic_2016_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2017_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2018_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2019_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2020_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2021_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2022_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2023_nglocal":0.0,"ic_2016_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2017_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2018_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2019_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2020_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2021_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2022_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2023_ngloan":0.0,"ic_2016_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2017_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2018_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2019_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2020_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2021_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2022_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2023_odagrant":0.0,"ic_2016_gocc":0.0,"ic_2017_gocc":0.0,"ic_2018_gocc":0.0,"ic_2019_gocc":0.0,"ic_2020_gocc":0.0,"ic_2021_gocc":0.0,"ic_2022_gocc":0.0,"ic_2023_gocc":0.0,"ic_2016_lgu":0.0,"ic_2017_lgu":0.0,"ic_2018_lgu":0.0,"ic_2019_lgu":0.0,"ic_2020_lgu":0.0,"ic_2021_lgu":0.0,"ic_2022_lgu":0.0,"ic_2023_lgu":0.0,"ic_2016_ps":0.0,"ic_2017_ps":0.0,"ic_2018_ps":0.0,"ic_2019_ps":0.0,"ic_2020_ps":0.0,"ic_2021_ps":0.0,"ic_2022_ps":0.0,"ic_2023_ps":0.0,"ic_2016_others":0.0,"ic_2017_others":0.0,"ic_2018_others":0.0,"ic_2019_others":0.0,"ic_2020_others":0.0,"ic_2021_others":0.0,"ic_2022_others":0.0,"ic_2023_others":0.0,"project_status_id":1,"icc_required":0,"updates":"1.
