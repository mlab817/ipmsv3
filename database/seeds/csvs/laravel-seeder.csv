It will take-off from the gains and lessons of various DA programs such as project tracking by geo-tagging and building capacity of LGUs and farming and fishing communities to manage and sustain agri-fishery support infrastructure and services, among others.
The Project will operationalize the national and regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (AFMPs) through integration of plans at the provincial level. Also, the Project will be guided by the vulnerability and suitability assessment framework, which was initially used for the Central Philippines Rural Development Project (CPRDP) preparation. Also, it will develop value chain roadmaps that will serve as an input in the selection and prioritization of investments in the target areas.

The Project is aligned with the goals and priorities of the Philippine Development Plans (2011-2016) for a competitive and sustainable agriculture and fisheries sectors, will provide program-level support for the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (RA 8435) and advances the principles of Agrikulturang Pinoy (AgriPinoy) of sustainable resource management, local development and full service delivery from farm to table.

Local Planning: this component aims to enhance the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Plan through science-based tools and to harmonize regional and provincial Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan through the formulation of the Provincial Commodity Investment Plan using value chain approach.

Infrastructure Development: this component aims to improve the links from production areas to markets to enhance the efficiency of transporting agricultural products. It also aims for higher productivity as a result of increased cropping intensity and yields, food security and improved health from readily available potable water and lower post harvest losses resulting in higher volume of outputs and more efficient support facilities.

Enterprise Development: this component aims to engage broad sections of the sector in the production of marketable surplus through investments in strategic segments of priority commodity value chains and strengthening collaboration between DA and the Local Government Units. It shall strengthen and develop viable agri-fishery based enterprises through efficient value chain of key regional agri-fishery product.

The project aims to enhance production competitiveness of small and mid-sized farmers by establishing greenhouse technology for high value added agro-products, and increase farmers income by enhancing distribution channel in related to co-branding and local shipping in the Philippines.   The Korean Smart Farm Greenhouses offers the Philippine agriculture a possible solution to the country's climate change concern being experienced by our highland vegetable growers. It would be also a showcase for Good Agricultural Practice, addressing the food safety requirements in the Food Safety Law in the country.   The piloting of the Korean Style Greenhouse is also an avenue to get the advance climate proof greenhouse technology which can be utilized in organic crop production, and eventually gain an easy access to Korean market to boost Philippine agriculture. Aside from the productivity, the established operating software  will provide greenhouse environment information to farmers by mobile to help them manage operating risk.

Cotton, as a primary component of home-made fabrics, having been grown for long in the country as an industry, is among the major fibers that need to be revitalized and sustained. The Philippines used to produce cotton supplying a portion of the need of the textile mills in the country. Highest production was attained in 1992 when area planted to cotton reached 35,000 hectares and produced 14,400 MT raw cotton fiber (cotton lint). However, due to serious economic and technical considerations on cotton growing in recent years, there had been a substantial decline in hectarage and participation in the industry, with areas just primarily confined in research stations to date. 

 In as much as a home-grown cotton production technology had been developed, along with the availability of physical resources that convert cotton harvests into raw fiber, waiting to be refurbished for immediate use, cotton cultivation and processing can be sustained with proper support from the government.

Its sub-programs include:

A. Fisheries Development Program, which includes aquaculture (provision of fingerlings/broodstocks, cages, and seaweed propagules and farming implements); capture fisheries (provision of fiberglass boats and fishing gear and paraphernalia); post-harvest; and marketing development;

B. Fisheries Regulatory and law Enforcement Program;

C. Fisheries Extension Program, which includes extension, support, education and training services; establishment of technodemo farms; information support services; and stakeholders collaboration and partnership;

1. Limited support of some LGU partners in the implementation of Projects.
2. Reorientation activities for new administration both from the national and local which may cause delay of project implementation.
3. Limited qualified bidder/contractor which sometimes resulted to sub-standard goods delivered.
4. The need to realign projects to prioritize the commitments of the Management.
5. Disapproval of proposed establishment or rehabilitation of facilities/equipment to complement the implementation of existing projects such as fingerlings production and fish landing centers.
6. Limited manpower in the Provincial Fisheries Offices to conduct monitoring and evaluation of project beneficiaries.

Mitigation Strategies:

1. Encourage community participation in the fabrication of some projects such as fiberglass boats to avoid bulk procurement.
2. Realign fund to cater the commitments of the Management.
3. Strengthen the capacity of the Provincial Fisheries Offices personnel to conduct monitoring and evaluation and hire additional personnel in areas where lacking.
4.

c.  The NDA will initially oversee the center under its Business Development Unit and eventually tap the NDA trained personnel of the Federation or dairy cooperatives to manage or run the centers. The dairy cooperatives/federations/private entities shall pay corresponding commissioned-based fees to NDA for every product sold in the center. The fees collected will go back to the marketing centers to cover the maintenance costs.
d. NDA will continuously monitor the marketing centers.

2. Establishment of Dairy Post-harvest facilities 
a. Post-harvest facilities such as milk collection centers with cold storage equipment shall be established to ensure the quality of milk collected for processing plants. 
b. Farmers can go to these collection centers and sell their raw milk produce and the collection center will bring the milk to the milk processing plant.
c. The NDA will establish these milk collection centers and shall be leased (Lease to own scheme) to cooperatives or federations.
d. Through a partnership forged between the federation or cooperatives and the marketing center thru NDA, products from the milk processing plants will be supplied to the marketing centers.

B. Capacity Building

As the country recognizes the need to develop its dairy industry, priority programs such as training programs for dairy farmers and cooperatives shall be enhanced. Dairy sector’s competiveness and capacities will be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. The following trainings will be conducted:
a. Homebased Milk Processing
b. Milk Quality Assurance
c. Business Management (Accounting & Bookkeeping)
d. Milk Marketing
e. Trainings on other business opportunities (meat processing (for male calves), vermi-culture, biogas, forage production)

This project aims to enhance existing dairy-based livelihood particularly on milk collection, processing and marketing to make dairying a sustainable source of income for dairy farmers. It intends to promote the marketability of locally produced milk and milk products.",19,0,2020-05001-000135,2,11.0,"['16', '3', '40', '7', '10', '11']",,['85'],1,1.0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,['6'],['18'],['3'],As of date no funding source,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,Have yet to identify funding source,2018-10-25,8,['9'],,"1.

In this concept, communities will be identified where dairy goat farms will be established and will function as a goat multiplier farm, dairy production area, and learning site. In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.

The implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.

The beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.

In the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.

This is designed to safeguard the project and the animals from threats like non-compliance of beneficiaries, lack of resources, and poor monitoring and to ensure that the targets are achieved and the recipients will experience the impact of the program in their lives.",19,0,2020-05001-000142,2,14.0,"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']",,['17'],1,1.0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,['6'],['18'],['3'],"Implementation Risk as follows:

It is the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry through policy direction and program coordination and implementation. The main goal of the NDA is to establish a profitable, competitive and sustainable growing dairy industry built on financially viable business performance throughout the value chain, providing good quality of life for farmers and ensuring consumers safe and quality milk and milk products.Majority of the Philippines’s annual dairy requirement is supplied by importers and processors. Local production continues to increase annually but not enough to cover local demand. In 2017 it imported 417,07 million kilograms of milk by 185 importers, processors and traders. In same year local production was only 22,76 million kilograms of milk. Milk is third largest agri-import.Philippines’s dairy sector represents a big potential for an improvement of a quality of life in rural areas. Development of milk production will have positive effects on unemployment rate and socio-economic situation in rural areas.  The NDA is given very limited funds every year to capacitate a total of 2,418 dairy farmers in dairy production and management. The lack of funds contributed to the very limited technical assistance the NDA can provide to these dairy farmers resulting to wrong practices and not enough knowledge to run a dairy enterprise and make it profitable.

The NDA is focused on improvement of situation. In 2017, the NDA and Czech Republic’s Development Assistance (program Aid for Trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) have started a new project focused on situation of dairy sector in Philippines - “Assistance in analyzing and improving value chains in the dairy industry in Philippines”. In scope of the project, Czech dairy experts have visited Philippines’s farms. They have identified three main issues that are complicating development of dairy industry in Philippines:
insufficient capacities of extension workers
- insufficient capacities of dairy farmers 
- insufficient promotion of local (Philippines’s) production and consumption

The proposed project is consistent with and directly supports the NDA Charter Statement and Strategy Map (Annex A) of improving the stakeholders’ welfare, ensuring the enforcement of dairy quality standards from production to post-harvest, advocate for the patronage of local milk and milk products and enhancing the competency of NDA manpower and farmer-clients.
Finally, the proposed project will help realize the Philippine Agriculture’s goals of expanding opportunities for those engaged in agriculture production and increasing access of small and subsistence farmers to economic opportunities as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022.",19,0,2020-05001-000145,2,14.0,"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '14']",,['17'],1,2.0,1,0,,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,"18 September 2018 – The project was endorsed to the Embassy of Czech Republic for possible funding.

In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  
        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer’s association and farmer-beneficiaries.
        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.

The main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;
(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);
(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;
(3) produce and distribute at least 882,000 sisal planting materials (propagated sisal bulbils and suckers) to the target farmer-beneficiaries during implementation period; and
(4) capacitate the Stakeholders (LGU and farmer-beneficiaries) through conduct of Packaged of Technology (POT) on Sisal production from farm establishment to its cultural practices up to harvesting and its post-harvest practices as well as fiber quality improvement technologies.

Results include: 

- The production output of abaca fibres was increased up from 10 kg of fiber/day to 120 kg/day following the provision of simple machines that make it easier for the smallholder farmers to extract the fibres from the leaf sheaths. This contributed to the increase in income of the farmers. 

- A total of 36 smallholder farmers have been Rainforest Alliance certified on 149 ha of agricultural land (500 ha originally planned). 

The present strategic alliance aims to harness the results and lessons learnt for the diversification and expansion of the Abaca Sustainability Initiative (ASI), i.e. knowledge and experience are to be disseminated to new regions and firmly established with a view to achieve a broad impact and promoting structure-building results. 

Under ASI+, the approach is to be extended. The proven concept of GIZ's Farmer Business School approach will be introduced to promote the entrepreneurial skills and business management capacity of the smallholder farmers and their organizations in order to identify opportunities for enhancing their business operations and incomes. In addition, applied abaca research will be resumed, and the task of promoting resilience in the face of climate change will be addressed.

This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd’s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.

In addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.

This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting/Hauling and Tuxy Trading /Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.

The project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation. Feasibility study and logical framework was conducted and formulated thus, ready for takeoff once budget is available.

ATBSP is aligned to the newly approved Abaca Industry Roadmap of PhilFIDA. It is expected to meet the demand for the high-quality abaca fibers and uplift the status of life of abaca farmers most specially the indigenous people in rural areas.",19,0,2021-05001-000204,1,,[],,[],1,2.0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,"with completed project proposal, feasibility study and detailed engineering design",2019-10-16,8,['11'],,The project aims to increase income of abaca farmers who are members of an abaca farmer cooperative under the Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project by at least 100%.,['5'],"['1', '2']",,2021,2023,3,,3,,,,,,,,Detailed Engineering Design and Project Proposal,0,0,0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1290.0,['1'],,74,[],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200000000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"['4', '93']",6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,200000000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With the unstable current market price of natural rubber latex, most tappers seek other income generating activity to augment the families’ basic needs that solely depend on rubber latex production. Thus, the rubber industry is facing a scarcity of skilled tapper laborers. Tapping is the most costly activity in natural rubber production and the shortage of tappers is a serious problem in rubber plantations in the country. Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) systems are considered to be a solution to these issues by reducing the number of tappers required while increasing tappers' income.

Therefore, the need to improve the productivity and competitiveness of rubber cultivation is compulsory such as reduction of tapping labor and applying low tapping frequencies that may lessen the operational cost and can increase the marginal profit of rubber farmers. This activity will be compensated by the increase of hormonal stimulation by providing latex stimulant. With this tapping orientation, the profit of rubber tappers may increase since they will not solely depend on rubber tapping as their source of income.",19,0,2021-05001-000204,3,9.0,['9'],,['80'],1,2.0,1,0,,0,1,0,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,"(1) Project was approved during PRRI Collegial Review;

Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. 

Data and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.

Voice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.

The ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals. This also includes the proposed ICT organizational structure to cope with changing requirements and fast-paced technology.

Ancestors of the present-day Philippine horse, which were either of Malay and Indian stock, were brought into the country by traders and travelers from Indonesia by way of Sulu or of Chinese bloodlines (Mackie, 1916). These horses were crossed to purebred horses brought in by successive colonizers with the purpose of improving the native breed as they were believed to be small in stature and considered not fit for military use. Horses that were considered “small” were relegated to farm use, for hauling farm produce. Most of these horses were also depended upon as daily conveyance by those who cannot afford to own a horse.

Today, horses still perform a significant role in agriculture and in our daily life. Known for their strength, speed, sure-footedness and intelligence, horses remain as the source of draft power in remote areas. The horse is also popular in equestrian sports such as racing, polo, pleasure-riding and rodeos which generate jobs that stimulate industry and promote tourism. When the need arises, it becomes an alternative source of protein and funds in emergency situations. Several towns still use horses to pull the calesa as an alternative to motorized transport and as a tool to promote tourism. Horse-fighting is also popular in some areas because of cultural practices. The horse is also expected to figure prominently in the promotion of agri-tourism. 

With the important role of horses in Philippine agriculture, it is imperative that support be provided to harness its full potential as work animal, as a potential source of food and livelihood.
This project aims to conserve and improve the Philippine horse as a source draft power, food and livelihood.",19,0,2021-05001-000229,3,40.0,['40'],,['12'],1,2.0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,With approved concept note and project proposal and detailed engineering design.

An inclusive and globally competitive rubber industry providing sustainable benefits to all stakeholders is envisioned for the Philippine rubber industry, with the goal of increasing the benefits of all the stakeholders, thereby spreading the gains down to the smallholders in the remote barangays in all rubber producing provinces in the regions. For the past year, low production of rubber yield emerges as a major constraint in the rubber industry which is mainly attributed in low pricing, in addition the improper fertilization management/nutrient management, emergence of pests and diseases, uses of unsuited rubber clones for plantation, lack of information on rubber clone agronomic characteristics and natural calamities. The development of technologies to support decision-making in production, pricing, good agricultural practices, market, pest and diseases management. The derived information will be useful for the farmers, planners, and researchers. Philippines Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) needs timely accurate statistics on natural rubber regularly to monitor and to take suitable measures in the interest of the Philippines rubber sector.	

Generally, this study will enable the Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) to map the areas vulnerable to soil erosion, estimating the area for further cultivation, and clone suitability map through GIS and Remote Sensing technologies.

While such equipment offers a wide range of benefits in terms of developing and increasing production of forage for dairy animals, not all dairy farmers have the capacity to purchase their own equipment taking into account the financial obligations that they need to fulfil in managing their respective farms.

As the agency mandated to accelerate the development of the local dairy industry, the NDA is committed to providing the local dairy farmers the access to various dairy equipment and facilities that can be of great help in improving their dairy farm operations. It is in this light, that the NDA would like to propose the provision of one (1) agricultural tractor, one (1) forage chopper, one (1) truck, and one (1) warehouse to each of the six (6) Regional Departments of the NDA namely, Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Central Visayas, Western Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Southern Mindanao. 

The NDA shall be the executing agency of the project whose major tasks include: formulating rules and guidelines as regards to the use of the tractor and forage chopper; deployment of the equipment to the requesting farmers/farmers' groups; overall maintenance of the equipment; and conduct of regular monitoring of the project. 

The NDA uses this proposed project as the vehicle to support local dairy farmers in their goal of further enhancing dairy farm operations to achieve better milk yield and ensuring the availability of feeds for dairy animals. In addition, the agency seeks to develop more contract growers to serve as feeds source of the local dairy farmers and contract growers for specialized skills in calf rearing and grow-out farming. 

The tractors, trucks, and forage choppers would be provided on hire basis to the local dairy farmers through the NDA Regional Department assisting them. Each department shall be responsible in ensuring the equity in the distribution of assistance to the farmers.

The project will enhance farm operations and increase forage production of local dairy farmers. It also aims to develop more contract growers as feeds source.",19,0,2021-05001-000254,2,11.0,"['3', '40', '7', '10', '11']",,"['12', '17', '25', '29', '81']",1,1.0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,No project fund as of September 2019.

1.4  Laboratory services on fiber identification, analysis of morphological, physical and chemical properties of fibers are undertaken to cater to the needs of the industry stakeholders such as the farmers, cordage makers, pulp processors and trade exporters of raw fibers. The Fiber Processing and Utilization Laboratory (FPUL) provides state-of-the-art capabilities for the testing and study of natural fibers emphasizing the characteristics to achieve desired fiber properties and functions.  It is a science-based user facility simultaneously developing strong scientific programs while offering broad access to its capabilities and collaboration. The FPUL can assist the businesses in complying with the requests needed.  The sectors that would most likely support the upgrading of the FPUL are the farmers, fiber processors, academe, private businessmen and LGUs. In all cases, the local government units always request FPUL for technical assistance in terms of value-adding activities and income generation/employment opportunities.  These activities can easily be adapted by their constituents because of the following reasons: a.  Doable and can be considered as a backyard industry b.  Developed products

The project aims to increase income of farmers and fisherfolk in the ICCs/IPs through the  development of sustainable agri.-fishery-based economic activities.
1.	To organize and strengthen the ICCs/IPs through capability building in planning, implementing and monitoring the interventions provided by the project. 
2.	To increase agricultural production of ICCs/IPs.
3.	To increase volume of sales of targeted agri.-fishery commodities of participating ICCs/IPs.
4.	To improve accessibility to transport agriculture and fishery-based products to the market.

To increase employment opportunities in the ICCs/IPs.",19,0,2021-05001-000298,2,14.0,"['8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14']",,"['28', '29', '78', '79', '80']",1,1.0,0,1,3.0,1,1,0,0,,Yet to be submitted to NEDA Secretariat,2019-10-27,,,,,['6'],['18'],['2'],"The project was initially categorized as a ""B"" consistent with the nature of these impacts and the requirements of OP4.01 (Environmental Impact Assessment).  Further assessment is now needed in regard to the following safeguards policies:  (i) Natural habitat  (OP/BP 4.04);  (ii) pest management (OP/BP 4.09) ;  (iii) indigenous peoples (OP/BP 4.10); (iv) involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); and (v) physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11). 

An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) need to be prepared. It would include screening procedures to guide the proponents on the type of safeguards instruments that need to be prepared depending on the sub-projects that would be funded.  This includes the preparation of environmental screening criteria and the applicable safeguard instruments such as the ESMP, Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP), Pest Management Plan (PMP), cultural heritage inventory process, chance finds procedures, grievance redress mechanism and others.  Two studies have been completed to inform the project design: (i) “Gender Tagging in Agriculture Sector;” and (ii)“Participation of Young Farmer-Entrepreneurs in Agribusiness.”

An Operations Manual will be developed and patterned to the implementation of the PRDP.

We would like to improve the processes along the value chain to get better prices for farmers' produce.In the long-run, we would like our farmers to be able to effectively engage in entrepreneurship in order to be able to sell directly to consumers/buyers thereby reducing the multi-layered marketing system for vegetables.	

Specifically, this aims to improve the farming practices, post-harvest and marketing system with new and appropriate technologies to provide better value of farmers' products; to capacitate AMAS, AMAD, LGUs, and farmers with new farming, value-adding, and marketing technologies.",19,0,2021-05001-000299,2,40.0,"['15', '2', '40']",,"['13', '55', '61']",1,1.0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,[],[],[],,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0,With concept note,2019-10-28,8,[],1.0,"(1) Developed and enhanced Vegetable value Chain Roadmap;
