Ancestors of the present-day Philippine horse, which were either of Malay and Indian stock, were brought into the country by traders and travelers from Indonesia by way of Sulu or of Chinese bloodlines (Mackie, 1916). These horses were crossed to purebred horses brought in by successive colonizers with the purpose of improving the native breed as they were believed to be small in stature and considered not fit for military use. Horses that were considered “small” were relegated to farm use, for hauling farm produce. Most of these horses were also depended upon as daily conveyance by those who cannot afford to own a horse.

Today, horses still perform a significant role in agriculture and in our daily life. Known for their strength, speed, sure-footedness and intelligence, horses remain as the source of draft power in remote areas. The horse is also popular in equestrian sports such as racing, polo, pleasure-riding and rodeos which generate jobs that stimulate industry and promote tourism. When the need arises, it becomes an alternative source of protein and funds in emergency situations. Several towns still use horses to pull the calesa as an alternative to motorized transport and as a tool to promote tourism. Horse-fighting is also popular in some areas because of cultural practices. The horse is also expected to figure prominently in the promotion of agri-tourism. 

With the important role of horses in Philippine agriculture, it is imperative that support be provided to harness its full potential as work animal, as a potential source of food and livelihood.

In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.

The implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.

The beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.

In the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.

• Joint Policy Research in Philippine Dairy Development Policy and Regulation. Dairy experts from Korea and Philippines and if necessary, with possible involvement of other ASAN and Asia Pacific resource persons, who shall jointly collaborate to review existing Philippine dairy policies and issuances, and come up with recommended courses of actions.
• The most critical areas which include dairy production, processing and marketing will be studied to find critical issues and problems and how to solve them. Results will be used as baseline data for further collaborative projects which may include infrastructure and technology development.

Component 2: Knowledge Sharing
• Short-term Trainings on 
   a. Dairy Policy Analysis and Development in Korea and 
   b. Dairy Regulation Standard Settings & Review in the Philippines.
   c. Dairy Extension and Dissemination Strategies on critical areas in production, processing and marketing.
• Country-industry Mission/Visits on successful public and private dairy enterprises in Korea and Philippines.
• Country-industry workshops on Dairy Development Policy and Review Collaboration.

Component 3: Dairy Project Identification and Development
• Project shortlisting and conceptualization workshops.
• Project proposal preparation.

Through this project, the dairy sector’s competiveness and capacities will also be fully strengthened in the country as extension services will continue to magnify its horizons by providing adequate and timely training and education. These are some of the areas that needs improvement in order to speed up, accelerate and increase dairy productivity and the number of farmers involved in the industry.

Specific Objectives:
• To develop high impact and sustainable Country Dairy Policies;
• To institutionalize the PHILKOR Dairy Development Cooperation; and,
• To operationalize the priority projects listed in the Public Investment Program 2017-2022:

It is the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry through policy direction and program coordination and implementation. The main goal of the NDA is to establish a profitable, competitive and sustainable growing dairy industry built on financially viable business performance throughout the value chain, providing good quality of life for farmers and ensuring consumers safe and quality milk and milk products.Majority of the Philippines’s annual dairy requirement is supplied by importers and processors. Local production continues to increase annually but not enough to cover local demand. In 2017 it imported 417,07 million kilograms of milk by 185 importers, processors and traders. In same year local production was only 22,76 million kilograms of milk. Milk is third largest agri-import.Philippines’s dairy sector represents a big potential for an improvement of a quality of life in rural areas. Development of milk production will have positive effects on unemployment rate and socio-economic situation in rural areas.  The NDA is given very limited funds every year to capacitate a total of 2,418 dairy farmers in dairy production and management. The lack of funds contributed to the very limited technical assistance the NDA can provide to these dairy farmers resulting to wrong practices and not enough knowledge to run a dairy enterprise and make it profitable.

The NDA is focused on improvement of situation. In 2017, the NDA and Czech Republic’s Development Assistance (program Aid for Trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) have started a new project focused on situation of dairy sector in Philippines - “Assistance in analyzing and improving value chains in the dairy industry in Philippines”. In scope of the project, Czech dairy experts have visited Philippines’s farms. They have identified three main issues that are complicating development of dairy industry in Philippines:
insufficient capacities of extension workers
- insufficient capacities of dairy farmers 
- insufficient promotion of local (Philippines’s) production and consumption

The proposed project is consistent with and directly supports the NDA Charter Statement and Strategy Map (Annex A) of improving the stakeholders’ welfare, ensuring the enforcement of dairy quality standards from production to post-harvest, advocate for the patronage of local milk and milk products and enhancing the competency of NDA manpower and farmer-clients.
Finally, the proposed project will help realize the Philippine Agriculture’s goals of expanding opportunities for those engaged in agriculture production and increasing access of small and subsistence farmers to economic opportunities as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022.",2020-05001-000145,2,14,"['15', '1', '2', '3', '40', '41', '5', '6', '7', '8', '14']",['17'],1,2,0,,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,[],[],[],,1,0,"18 September 2018 – The project was endorsed to the Embassy of Czech Republic for possible funding.

This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd’s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.

In addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.

This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting/Hauling and Tuxy Trading /Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.

The project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation.

In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  
        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer’s association and farmer-beneficiaries.
        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.

The main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;
(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);
(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;
(3) produce and distribute at least 882,000 sisal planting materials (propagated sisal bulbils and suckers) to the target farmer-beneficiaries during implementation period; and
(4) capacitate the Stakeholders (LGU and farmer-beneficiaries) through conduct of Packaged of Technology (POT) on Sisal production from farm establishment to its cultural practices up to harvesting and its post-harvest practices as well as fiber quality improvement technologies.
