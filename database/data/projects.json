The project aims to enhance production competitiveness of small and mid-sized farmers by establishing greenhouse technology for high value added agro-products, and increase farmers income by enhancing distribution channel in related to co-branding and local shipping in the Philippines.   The Korean Smart Farm Greenhouses offers the Philippine agriculture a possible solution to the country's climate change concern being experienced by our highland vegetable growers. It would be also a showcase for Good Agricultural Practice, addressing the food safety requirements in the Food Safety Law in the country.   The piloting of the Korean Style Greenhouse is also an avenue to get the advance climate proof greenhouse technology which can be utilized in organic crop production, and eventually gain an easy access to Korean market to boost Philippine agriculture. Aside from the productivity, the established operating software  will provide greenhouse environment information to farmers by mobile to help them manage operating risk. Also, the environmental and production data collected through the software will guide to establish environmental control system optimized in the local environment of the Philippines.",

In this concept, communities will be identified where dairy goat farms will be established and will function as a goat multiplier farm, dairy production area, and learning site. In this arrangement, farmers will raise the animals given to them by the program in a common area with complete facilities and provision of necessary implements. They will be assisted too in the marketing through the program initiatives.\n\nThe implementation of the program will be by module, wherein one beneficiary community will receive one. A module of this program will have the following components: 100 breeder does and 5 breeder bucks; 1 goat house; Developed pasture; Milking and milk processing and storage equipment; Farm implements; Barn and storage; Starting feeds, drugs, and biologics; and Training of recipients.\n\nThe beneficiaries shall provide an agricultural land area (minimum of 4 hectares) for the project as a counterpart. The daily operations and accompanying costs of operation will be shouldered by the beneficiaries. The farmer beneficiaries and their families will operate the farm, each owning 10 heads of does. The milk produced will be processed in the farm and will be marketed as a whole. Income will then be divided among the beneficiaries depending on the volume of their production on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIn the aspect of marketing, the program had included the milk-feeding strategy to ensure a ready market for the milk produced by the farms. The milk-feeding concept will be an outfit that will buy the milks produced and processed by the modules and bring it for milk-feeding programs for malnourished children in the locality. With this set-up, the program will not only resolve the market obstacle, but will help address malnutrition among children.\n\nThis is designed to safeguard the project and the animals from threats like non-compliance of beneficiaries, lack of resources, and poor monitoring and to ensure that the targets are achieved and the recipients will experience the impact of the program in their lives.",

The establishment of milk processing centers and engagement in dairy farming will give opportunities for employment to residents in rural areas near the centers and farms and will reduce propensity to migrate to urban areas.\n\nThe project aims to contribute in the dairy industry development in the country, specifically:\n  - Contribute 95% of the national milk target (or 40% of the milk deficiency3) through sustainable production and processing of 125 tons of local milk daily by increasing the number of dairy animals by at least one (1) boatload (1,200 head) every year through importation and upgrade of local dairy cattle;\n  - To create livelihood and employment opportunities in accordance to the rural industrialization and dispersal programs provided for in the AFMA.",

    "description": "The National Dairy Authority (NDA) was established in 1995. It is the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry through policy direction and program coordination and implementation. The main goal of the NDA is to establish a profitable, competitive and sustainable growing dairy industry built on financially viable business performance throughout the value chain, providing good quality of life for farmers and ensuring consumers safe and quality milk and milk products.Majority of the Philippines’s annual dairy requirement is supplied by importers and processors. Local production continues to increase annually but not enough to cover local demand. In 2017 it imported 417,07 million kilograms of milk by 185 importers, processors and traders. In same year local production was only 22,76 million kilograms of milk. Milk is third largest agri-import.Philippines’s dairy sector represents a big potential for an improvement of a quality of life in rural areas. Development of milk production will have positive effects on unemployment rate and socio-economic situation in rural areas.  The NDA is given very limited funds every year to capacitate a total of 2,418 dairy farmers in dairy production and management. The lack of funds contributed to the very limited technical assistance the NDA can provide to these dairy farmers resulting to wrong practices and not enough knowledge to run a dairy enterprise and make it profitable.\n\nThe NDA is focused on improvement of situation. In 2017, the NDA and Czech Republic’s Development Assistance (program Aid for Trade of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) have started a new project focused on situation of dairy sector in Philippines - “Assistance in analyzing and improving value chains in the dairy industry in Philippines”. In scope of the project, Czech dairy experts have visited Philippines’s farms. They have identified three main issues that are complicating development of dairy industry in Philippines:\ninsufficient capacities of extension workers\n- insufficient capacities of dairy farmers \n- insufficient promotion of local (Philippines’s) production and consumption\n\nThe proposed project is consistent with and directly supports the NDA Charter Statement and Strategy Map (Annex A) of improving the stakeholders’ welfare, ensuring the enforcement of dairy quality standards from production to post-harvest, advocate for the patronage of local milk and milk products and enhancing the competency of NDA manpower and farmer-clients.\nFinally, the proposed project will help realize the Philippine Agriculture’s goals of expanding opportunities for those engaged in agriculture production and increasing access of small and subsistence farmers to economic opportunities as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017-2022.",
    "expected_outputs": "The project “Strengthening Capacities of Dairy Farmers & Extension Workers” has three main outputs.\n\nOUTPUT 1: Capacity of dairy extension workers have been increased\nFirst output will be achieved by training of 20 dairy extensions workers of NDA in 4 Philippines’s regions. It will be also achieved by creation of guidebook for dairy workers on animal welfare, animal nutrition, breeding, and dairy product processing. \n\nOUTPUT 2: Capacity of dairy farmers have been increased\nSecond output will be achieved by training of 80 to 200 dairy farmers in 4 Philippines’s regions. It will be also achieved by creation of guidebook for dairy workers on animal welfare, animal nutrition, breeding, and dairy product processing. \n\nOUTPUT 3: Philippines local milk consumption have been promoted\nThird output will be achieved by creation of a website for promotion of consumption of local milk products.",

This valuable tool helps evaluate the progress of the herd’s milk production while addressing the improvement of the different production management system including breeding, health and nutrition. Through the DHIP, the breeding program of the carabaos at the local level will have a clear direction and its progress is measured over time to ensure that the animals are improving in terms of breeding performance. The DHIP is fairly inexpensive, useful and exciting activity that only requires constant monitoring and evaluation including documentation of activities.\n\nIn addition, the dairy herd improvement (DHI) system has a played a critical role in the advancement of the dairy industry.  Even today, it remains an important link in the industry. However, dairy industry changes, such as animal number decreases and shifts, dairy management advances, and on-farm economics, pose significant challenges to DHI. The nature of the dairy market, changing technology, and competitive pressures indicate the need for strategic planning and implementation among DHI participants, players and stakeholders.\n\nThe project is expected to benefit some 150,000 dairy farmers and 190 organized groups.",

    "description": "The Abaca Tuxy Buying Special Project (ATBSP) is the new approach to be implemented by the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA) in the production of excellent abaca fiber. This scheme will ensure the survival of abaca which is indigenous to the Philippines. Using a corporative approach, the project aims to organize and empower most of the abaca farmers nationwide as a cooperative, produce their own abaca fibers as a group which will redound to better competitive price, quality and quantity and sell their harvest directly to Grading and Baling Establishments (GBEs) and local processors. A group of abaca farmers with contiguous abaca farms for at least one hectare per farmer shall be formed into a cooperative with at least 100 active farmer-members and should be accredited with the Department of Agriculture (DA).  This project also aims to reduce the activity being done by the farmers to increase their productivity. The traditional way of abaca fiber extraction/harvesting by the abaca farmers has twelve (12) stages.  The project intends to lessen it to only six (6) steps --Topping, Tumbling, Tuxying, Tuxy Bundling, Tuxy Transporting/Hauling and Tuxy Trading /Selling --  thereby removing and easing the burden of the abaca farmers of the other six (6) activities and just let them continue producing all the abaca tuxies they want for the day before selling it to their cooperative that same day. This will surely increase abaca fiber production.\n\nThe project has an estimated budgetary requirement of about P20 million to cover the warehouse, stripping, drying and office buildings, equipment and facilities, hauling truck and motorcycles and seed capital for the initial operation. Feasibility study and logical framework was conducted and formulated thus, ready for takeoff once budget is available.\n\nATBSP is aligned to the newly approved Abaca Industry Roadmap of PhilFIDA. It is expected to meet the demand for the high-quality abaca fibers and uplift the status of life of abaca farmers most specially the indigenous people in rural areas.",

The Philippines used to produce cotton supplying a portion of the need of the textile mills in the country. Highest production was attained in 1992 when area planted to cotton reached 35,000 hectares and produced 14,400 MT raw cotton fiber (cotton lint). However, due to serious economic and technical considerations on cotton growing in recent years, there had been a substantial decline in hectarage and participation in the industry, with areas just primarily confined in research stations to date. \n\n In as much as a home-grown cotton production technology had been developed, along with the availability of physical resources that convert cotton harvests into raw fiber, waiting to be refurbished for immediate use, cotton cultivation and processing can be sustained with proper support from the government. \n\nTo revitalize the cotton industry in order to sustain the production of cotton fibers for small-scale cotton users, such as local loom-weavers and knitters, and eventually for commercial-size cotton production and utilization.",

Information needed in the implementation of these programs is dispersed to all provincial and regional offices. Obtaining such information from one office to another may cause some difficulty and a possible duplication of efforts in maintaining similar systems and/or databases across different field offices occurs due to the geographical concerns. Obviously, there is a need to integrate information sources and build-up an agency-wide knowledge databank and up-to-date web portal to ensure easy access to updated, relevant and timely information. Improvement of electronic links within the organization as well as with the other external entities is also necessary. \n\nData and information systems on the geographical location of programs and projects of the agency presented in electronic maps are also needed to be developed for effective monitoring and to reduce the need for clients to physically go to PhilFIDA offices to avail of services or obtain the information they need. An improved internal system can be better delivered through the use of latest technologies on intranet and extranet solutions, particularly through web-enabled applications.\n\nVoice and data communication technologies can manage coordinative works between central office and different provincial and regional offices. Centralized system within the agency will further enhance productivity through web-enabled applications.\n\nThe ISSP aims to guide PhilFIDA in the implementation of its ICT initiatives and projects to enhance its performance and achieve its goals.

    "description": "Sisal is wildly and sporadically growing in almost all of the provinces of Central Visayas, specifically in the provinces of Cebu and Siquijor.  In most cases, it is traditionally grown along hedges to demarcate farm boundaries, and to produce fiber ropes for farm use and/or to supplement incomes.  It can be observed that such fibercrop thrive well in the harsh conditions and mostly in the unproductive and marginal land in the said provinces, being a drought resistance perennial crops.  If properly introduce and adopted, sisal farming can be a good alternative livelihood for farmers whose farm cannot be utilized to cultivate food crops -  such as, corn, rootcrop, etc., that the most farmers in this provinces traditional produced.  Its production requires virtually no external inputs (i.e. fertilizer, insecticides, and/or pesticides) after planting and provides protection against soil erosion.  The leaves used for fiber production can be harvested continuously throughout the year for roughly 15-year period without replanting it and allows farmers to harvest whenever the need for additional income is at the highest.  As such, it can support sustainable agriculture initiative of the community by sustaining the economic viability of farm operation, enhancing the environmental quality, the natural resources base upon which the agricultural economy as well as the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.  In addition, it can from part of the overall solution to climate change.   Thus, this project is being proposed and will be known as Sisal Development Project primarily aimed to provide alternative livelihood and sustain economic activities to our people in the countryside thru sisal farming and help augment their standard of living.  \n        Components of this project shall include the Establishment of Sisal Nurseries in six (6) different locations to sustain the planting materials need of the beneficiaries.  Likewise, planting materials production and distribution to support the development of new sisal production areas and of course with institutional strengthening through Training and Education, that includes the conduct of Training of Trainers (TOTs) for LGU Technicians and farmer leaders as well as the LGU-led Livelihood Training to capacitate the identified LGUs, farmer’s association and farmer-beneficiaries.\n        This project is a collaborative undertaking of partner agencies like PhilFIDA, Department of Agriculture, Local Government Units (Municipal and Provincial LGU) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), in order to maximize resources, work hand in hand geared towards one and common desire to give the best possible service to our clientele.\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to uplift the quality of life of our people in the countryside through increased productivity and real income by insuring stability of the fiber industry in the country.  It specifically aims to;\n(1)  develop an aggregate of two hundred ten (210) hectares sisal areas in the provinces of Bohol (30-ha), Cebu (75-ha), Negros Oriental (30-ha), and Siquijor (75-ha.);\n(2) establish six (6) hectares Sisal Nurseries as source of planting material needs of the beneficiaries for the development of new sisal production areas in the targeted provinces;\n(3) produce and distribute at least 882,000 sisal planting materials (propagated sisal bulbils and suckers) to the target farmer-beneficiaries during implementation period; and\n(4) capacitate the Stakeholders (LGU and farmer-beneficiaries) through conduct of Packaged of Technology (POT) on Sisal production from farm establishment to its cultural practices up to harvesting and its post-harvest practices as well as fiber quality improvement technologies.  \n(5) Ten (10) hectares of sisal is to be planted in Region I to supply the needs of the local pulp millers.",
    "expected_outputs": "The following are the expected output of the project: \n(a) established/maintained sisal nursery/ies as the source of seeds/planting materials for future production area expansion; \n(b) opened 210-hectare new sisal production areas in the region; \n(c) capacitated the LGU-technician and farmers in production salago fiber; and \n(4) provide additional livelihood activities in the rural communities.",

An inclusive and globally competitive rubber industry providing sustainable benefits to all stakeholders is envisioned for the Philippine rubber industry, with the goal of increasing the benefits of all the stakeholders, thereby spreading the gains down to the smallholders in the remote barangays in all rubber producing provinces in the regions. For the past year, low production of rubber yield emerges as a major constraint in the rubber industry which is mainly attributed in low pricing, in addition the improper fertilization management/nutrient management, emergence of pests and diseases, uses of unsuited rubber clones for plantation, lack of information on rubber clone agronomic characteristics and natural calamities. The development of technologies to support decision-making in production, pricing, good agricultural practices, market, pest and diseases management. The derived information will be useful for the farmers, planners, and researchers. Philippines Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) needs timely accurate statistics on natural rubber regularly to monitor and to take suitable measures in the interest of the Philippines rubber sector.\t\n\nGenerally, this study will enable the Philippine Rubber Research Institute (PRRI) to map the areas vulnerable to soil erosion, estimating the area for further cultivation, and clone suitability map through GIS and Remote Sensing technologies.

Pests and diseases of rubber could prevent and reduce the full yield potential in the rubber industry. \n\nLimited information can be found regarding the distribution of termite pest and fungal diseases of rubber in the Philippines. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of these diseases in and among rubber plantations and on consequences related to disease infection or disorder and eventual latex yield loss is important to consider in formulating effective integrated disease management strategies. This is also critical in sustaining the rubber industry especially in rehabilitating senile rubber plantations as planting materials can be severely infected to fungal diseases present in the field or from the neighboring rubber plantations. GIS maps are one of the tools in forecasting disease outbreaks and estimating damage and consequently in designing cost-effective and location-specific pest and disease management strategies appropriate for different cropping systems in the Zamboanga Peninsula.

    "description": "The cultivation of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in the Philippines is predominantly played by small rubber farmers holding only three hectares or less. With the unstable current market price of natural rubber latex, most tappers seek other income generating activity to augment the families’ basic needs that solely depend on rubber latex production. Thus, the rubber industry is facing a scarcity of skilled tapper laborers. Tapping is the most costly activity in natural rubber production and the shortage of tappers is a serious problem in rubber plantations in the country. Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) systems are considered to be a solution to these issues by reducing the number of tappers required while increasing tappers' income.\n\nTherefore, the need to improve the productivity and competitiveness of rubber cultivation is compulsory such as reduction of tapping labor and applying low tapping frequencies that may lessen the operational cost and can increase the marginal profit of rubber farmers. This activity will be compensated by the increase of hormonal stimulation by providing latex stimulant. With this tapping orientation, the profit of rubber tappers may increase since they will not solely depend on rubber tapping as their source of income.",

    "description": "Corynespora Leaf Fall Disease (CLFD) caused by a fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola is one of the major diseases which poses serious threat to natural rubber production in rubber growing countries of South and South East Asia (Edathil et.al. 2000).This disease is regularly causing more damage in any plant growth stages (i.e. nursery, immature and mature trees). Occurrence of this disease causes repeated post wintering defoliation that adversely affect the tree, resulting in reduced production and yield loss can be of more than 45 per cent. \n\nIn order to keep the sustainability of quality rubber production, there is a need to have an efficient disease management strategy in modern rubber growing. Despite the economic effect of CLF disease-causing pathogen on commercially grown rubber in the Philippines, screening for susceptibility among clones as a method to improve the management of this disease have not been examined. Thus, this study aims to identify and evaluate potential susceptible and resistant clones and specie to Corynespora Leaf Fall disease from introduced Hevea clones and specie by inducing CLFD-pathogen to the leaves of seedlings of different rubber clones in nursery to determine whether clonal variation could be used to better manage the disease problem.",

But this technique highly relies on the used adsorbent. The low-cost adsorbent should be easily available, abundant in nature, or a waste product from industrial and agricultural sectors. Agricultural products such as carabao manure, coconut shell, rice hull and saw dust due to its chemical composition such as holocellulose, lignin, and ash.
